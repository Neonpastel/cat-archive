# About me

Hi! So I'm Cat or Sprite, whichever suits your fancy.

Oh, and here's a few of the things I do!


## Denperidge
This is where most of my professional/programming stuff goes! Check it out at [denperidge.com](https://denperidge.com). 

## Neonpastel.net
This is where you're currently at! Under this name I host my self-indulgent webcore projects & pages. For the more silly side of programming.

## Skunkat
Soda's and mine silly zone. A mix of webcore site making & wacky youtube videos

You can check us out at [skunkat.neocities.org](https://skunkat.neocities.org/)!

## Thannasanna
My personal video creation project. Currently mostly videos talking about mental health, but I hope to branch out sooner than later. You can check it out on [youtube.com/@Thannasanna](https://www.youtube.com/@thannasanna)!


## Compromised Neopets Password
My web info & archival psuedonym! It currently consists of two parts:

- Software archival; whenever I find an old DVD in my possesion, I throw it on there.
- Lyrics contributions; I listen to some more obscure music, and sometimes that means lyrics are hard to find. As a user of Spotify (sad trombone sound) but lover of Musixmatch, I quite like adding & syncing lyrics on there. But I'm also trying to add them to other platforms because they aren't paying me.
- Wiki contributions; sometimes I look at a wiki and see that it could be made better/worse.
